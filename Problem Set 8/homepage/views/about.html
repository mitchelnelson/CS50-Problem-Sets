        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>I am a student from Edmonton, Alberta currently taking CS50 on EdX. I am completing this website as a requirement for CS50's Problem Set 8. In the problem set, I am required to have at least 4 .html files. I must use 10 distinct HTML tags. There must be some implementation of Bootstrap. There must be a custom .css file with at least 5 different selectors and at least 5 different properties. There must also be implementation of JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology at the University of Alberta from 2016 to 2020. I enjoyed the program, but I found out over the years that it was not my calling. The sense of fulfillment was never there. Often, when others would ask, I would tell them that "It's a ways away to think about what I want to do for a career". Then, the Covid-19 Pandemic struck, and I really wanted nothing to do with kinesiology.</p>
        <p>The time alone made me wonder what I really wanted to do with my life. I knew I always loved computers, and I knew I always loved science. It is a little embarrassing to admit it never clicked in my head to take computer science as a possible career path. However, the sense of fulfillment is there for me. So, in Fall 2021, I will be returning to post-secondary studies at MacEwan University to complete an after-degree in Computer Science.</p>
