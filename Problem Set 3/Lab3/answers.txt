sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Bubble sort had better runtime, albeit marginal, compared to selection sort. The big Omega for bubble sort is only n, which likely accounts for this slight increase in speed.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Constantly outperforms sort1 and sort2 in terms of runtime. Merge sort is logarithmic in nature, and big O for merge sort is O(n log n). This is much better than O(log n^2) for the others.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Selection sort's big O and big Omega are both n^2, resulting in poor runtime. Selection sort generally underperformed in comparison to bubble sort, except for random values.
